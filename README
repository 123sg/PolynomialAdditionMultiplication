Instructions to run this program: Run the MainClass.java file.
1. To run under Windows command prompt or the Mac Terminal, first change into the folder
containing all of this project's java files. Type cd and the folder name.
2. Create class files for all java files. Type:
  javac MainClass.java
  javac Polynomial.java
  javac Node.java
3. Type java MainClass to run the program. To modify the polynomial you would like to add, modify the numbers 
in the arrays P1 and P2 in the code in the MainClass.java file.

About this program:
This program adds two given polynomials and multiplies two given polynomials.  For polynomials, the coefficients
are entered in the MainClass class in ascending order of their exponents.  For instance: 1, 2, 8 represents 
1^2 + 2^1 + 8^0.  I will eventually add file I/O to the MainClass class, where one can enter polynomial coefficients
by command line through a textfile of polynomial pairs, and the solutions would be outputed in another textfile. Enjoy!
